### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer from Germany.

I am the maintainer of [AsciidoctorJ](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj) and I love writing good documentation, even if it is so hard for me.

Besides spending my spare time as much as possible on AsciidoctorJ I am working on all things networking on Kubernetes, in particular with Kubernetes and Service Meshes/Istio.
